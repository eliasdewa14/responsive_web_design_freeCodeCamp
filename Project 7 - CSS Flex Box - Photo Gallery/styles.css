/* Normalize your box model by creating a * selector and setting the box-sizing property to border-box as the value. 

The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column. nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.

The justify-content property determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis,
affecting their position and the space around them.

The align-items property positions the flex content along the cross axis. In this case,
with your flex-direction set to row,
your cross axis would be vertical.

Notice how some of your images have become distorted. This is because the images have different aspect ratios. Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually,
you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave.
