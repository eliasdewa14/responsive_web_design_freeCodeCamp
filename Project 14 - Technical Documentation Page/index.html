                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank">DOM</a>) looks.</p>

                <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
                <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>

                <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>

                <h1>Getting started with JavaScript</h1>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code. You can practice on <a href="https://codepen.io/codeBelt/pen/OVjxJN" target="_blank">Code pen</a></p>
            </section>
			<section id="Variables" class="main-section">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier" target="_blank">identifiers</a>, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
                <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
                <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.</li>
                    <li>With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In var and let declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value undefined.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let x;
                        console.log(x); // logs "undefined"
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In essence, let <span>x = 42</span> is equivalent to <span>let x; x = 42</span>.</p>
                <p><span>const</span> declarations always need an initializer, because they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly initializing it with <span>undefined</span> is likely a programmer mistake.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        const x; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </section>
			<section id="Data_structures_and_types" class="main-section">
                <header>Data structures and types</header>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <h1>Data types</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object" target="_blank">object</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
            </section>
			<section id="Function" class="main-section">
                <header>Function</header>
                <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
                <h1>Function declarations</h1>
                <p>A <b>function definition</b> (also called a <b>function declaration</b>, or <b>function statement</b>) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        function square(number)
                        {
                            return number * number;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>return number * number;</code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section id="Classes" class="main-section">
                <header>Classes</header>
                <p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics. Classes are usually created with <em>class declarations</em>.</p>
                <h1>Define classes</h1>
                <p>Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.</p>
                <h1>Class declarations</h1>
                <p>One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class ("Rectangle" here).</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        class Rectangle {
                            constructor(height, width) {
                                this.height = height;
                                this.width = width;
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>The three key features of classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Constructor;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instance methods and instance fields;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Static methods and static fields.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Constructor</h1>
                <p>Perhaps the most important job of a class is to act as a "factory" for objects. For example, when we use the Date constructor, we expect it to give a new object which represents the date data we passed in — which we can then manipulate with other methods the instance exposes. In classes, the instance creation is done by the constructor.</p>

                <p>As an example, we would create a class called Color, which represents a specific color. Users create colors through passing in an RGB triplet.</p>
