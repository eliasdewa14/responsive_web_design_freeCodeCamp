# Responsive_web_design_freeCodeCamp

## Description

This Responsive Web Design Certification course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) includes the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

There are 20 projects available on this repository. The first project was about building a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Next, using modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.
